d4p-toolkits
============

configured open toolkits to support D4P continuous integration testing

These toolkits reflect the full-easy-install images with the docs, demo, tools, and
samples removed to save space. They are ready to use. tools/ is removed
since Jenkins provides its own Ant executable.
